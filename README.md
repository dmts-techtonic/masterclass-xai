# DMTS Master Class for Explainable AI

Welcome to the hands-on exercise for the DMTS Master Class on Explanable AI using LIME and SHAP frameworks. The hands-on exercise is in the form of Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file format). The python code for the exercise and the instructions to execute them are already in the provided Jupyter notebook. Paricipants are expected to read each of the instructions carefully and execute each of the steps in the given sequence. 

## Environment for the exercise
In order to work on the hands-on execise, a Jupyter notebook runtime environment is required. We recommend participants to use Google Colab for this exercise. Google Colab or “the Colaboratory” is a free cloud service hosted by Google proving a free Jupyter notebook environment for writing and executing python code. Colab requires no setup to use and all the python libraries required for the hands-on exercise are already preinstalled. 
	• In order to access Colab (https://colab.research.google.com), a valid Google Account is required.
	• As per Google's documentation Colab works with most major browsers, and is most thoroughly tested with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. 
	• More details about Colab can be found at https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html

## Instruction to load the Jupyter notebook to Colab environment
Log into http://colab.research.google.com/ using your Google Account. In the overlay that lists the existing notebooks, please select GitHub option.
The Jypyter notebook for this exercise is kept in Github URL https://github.com/bkasimani/dmts-mc/blob/main/lime_shap_strokev3.4.ipynb
Enter the above URL in the search field and it will display the exercise name 'lime_shap_strokevx.x.ipynb'. Click New Notebook which will create a new instance of the notebook with a copy from the GitHub. Please see the screenshot below for reference.

## Option 2 - Using individual's location laptop/desktop 
In case you already have Jupyter notebook runtime environment in your laptop and wish to run the exercise locally, you will need the following 
   • Python 3.3 or greater and Jupyter notebook runtime environment using Anaconda or other distributions
   • Modules required:  
	   • jupyter==1.0.0
	   • pandas==1.3.5
	   • numpy==1.21.6
	   • seaborn==0.11.2
	   • scikit-learn==1.0.2
	   • interpret==0.2.7
	   • imblearn=0.0
You can download the notebook from the URL given above and load to your environment.
Please note, due to large number of participants we may not be able to support environment related issues for each individual. Hence we recommend using Google Colab, as it requires minimal setup.


In case of any question please ask the DMTS SPOCs conducting the session.
